# Progress showcase repository

This is a small repository showcasing some of the skills I've picked up since starting my Algebra ASP.NET developer course in November.

Firstly, I've included exercises covering some basic and advanced C# principles while working with console apps. In addition to that, I've also included a few ASP.NET framework projects covering both basic principles of MVC architecture, and unit testing.

A couple of small disclaimers: 
- All of the projects are made using .NET 6, as the newer version of .NET 7 came out as we were starting the course.
- The projects that I've included haven't been changed since I created them as I've wanted to keep them that way to observe the progess I've made over the course

2. [Another simple console app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Another%20Simple%20Console%20App) where you can input and validate a phone number and an email address. The goal of the app was to go through some of the more advanced features of C#
