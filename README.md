# Progress showcase repository

This is a small repository showcasing some of the skills I've picked up since starting my Algebra ASP.NET developer course in November.

Firstly, I've included exercises covering some basic and advanced C# principles while working with console apps. In addition to that, I've also included a few ASP.NET framework projects covering both basic principles of MVC architecture, and unit testing.

Small disclaimer: All of the projects are made using .NET 6, as the newer version of .NET 7 came out as we were starting the course.
