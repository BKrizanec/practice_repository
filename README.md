# Progress showcase repository

This is a small repository showcasing some of the skills I've picked up and honed since starting my Algebra ASP.NET developer course in November.

Firstly, I've included exercises covering some basic and advanced C# principles while working with console apps. In addition to that, I've also included a few ASP.NET framework projects covering basic principles of MVC architecture, unit testing and working with Entity Framework.

A couple of small disclaimers: 
- All of the projects are made using .NET 6, as the newer version of .NET 7 was just coming out as we were starting the course.
- The projects that I've included haven't been changed since I've completed the tasks that were required of me. This was by design, as I've wanted to keep them that way, to observe the progess I've made over the course 

## Table of contents:
1. [A simple console app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Simple%20Input%20Console%20App) that was created to go through both all of the basics of C# and OOP 
2. [Another simple console app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Another%20Simple%20Console%20App) where you can input and validate a phone number and an email address. The goal of the app was to go through some of the more advanced features of C#
3. [A basic MVC ASP.NET framework app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Basic%20ASP.NET%20MVC) created for the purpose of practicing manipulating data within the MVC architecture
4. [Small sample of mock unit tests](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Unit%20testing) within a simple MVC app. The goal of this exercise was to practice simple unit testing within the MVC architecture
5. [MVC ASP.NET framework app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/CRUD%20practice) using CRUD and HTML forms to manipulate incoming data
6. [MVC ASP.NET framework app](https://github.com/BKrizanec/practice_repository/tree/main/Entity%20Framework%20and%20MVC) that incorporates Entity Framework Code First to link the app with the database. In order to run the app it's necessary to set up the connection string in the app settings depending on how you've set up your database
